To begin, click the Start button. A countdown timer for 60 seconds will begin and the first question of the quiz will be shown.

If your answer was wrong, the message "Wrong!" will be displayed below the answers for 1 second and 10 seconds will be removed from the countdown clock. The quiz ends when the timer hits 0 or when all questions are answered, whichever comes first.
